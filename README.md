# stroke-prediction
This Repository contains code and data for predicting stroke outcomes using a machine learning algorithm. the goal is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can successfully predict the likelihood  of a patient experiencing cancer given their medical history and current health status, age and smoking condition
# Data
the data set used for this project was collected from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset.
# Features
gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose, BMI(body mass index), smoking status
# Methods
I used the logistic Regression machine learning algorithm to develop the prediction model. The algorithm was trained on 80% of the dataset and tested on 20%.
Feature selection was performed on the dataset to get the best features which are the new features is 'age', 'hypertension', 'heart_disease', 'ever_married', 'avg_glucose_level' on which the dataset was trained
# Results
the model achieved an accuracy score of 93.93%
